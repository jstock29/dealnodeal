# dealnodeal
This is a repository devoted to the beautiful game of Deal or No Deal. I've decided to colllect game data from this show with the goal of analyzing it to figure out how the show works. This is where I'll do that.

## Data Collection
I'll collect data using Streamlit. You can run the app (assuming you have a Postgres database and update the credentials) with:

`streamlit run main.py`

## Data Analysis
I haven't got to this point yet, but once I do, I hope to approximate the Banker's algorithm using machine learning tools and/or by reverse engineering the algorithm myself.
